# DESCRIPTION:E-Learning Platform UI (Task-4)
In this task, I was asked to design the front-end of an E-Learning Platform using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main goal was to create a simple and user-friendly interface where users can browse through different courses, watch videos, and track their learning progress.

I created a course listing section where each course is clickable. When a user clicks on a course, an embedded YouTube video related to that course appears. Along with that, a progress bar updates to show how much of the content the user has completed.

I also added some basic styling using CSS to make the layout look clean and easy to navigate. The design is kept simple to look like a basic student project but still functional and interactive.

The task mainly focused on:

Course listing

Video embedding

Progress tracking

Clean and responsive UI

All the features were implemented without using any external libraries or backend. The final output is a multi-page interface that works smoothly and covers all the required features.
